Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences building web applications.

## What You'll Find Here

I'll be writing about:

- Rails development best practices
- Building scalable web applications
- Product development insights
- Technical deep dives into interesting problems

## Background

With over 5 years of experience building production Rails applications, I've learned a lot about what works (and what doesn't) when building for the web.

Stay tuned for more posts!
